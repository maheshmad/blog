Hi, I am Mahesh Madhusudanan and my passion is in finding new ways of applying technology to build great tools to help people.

I love designing and building software products that can highly scale. When I am not coding, I usually like spend time reading (in admiration and for inspiration) about things that other great minds have come up with.
