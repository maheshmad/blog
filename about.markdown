Hi, I am Mahesh Mad (as trying to pronounce "Madhusudanan" may demand few minutes of your life) and my passion is in finding new ways of applying technology to build great tools to help people.

I love designing and building software products. When I am not coding, I usually like spend time reading (in admiration and for inspiration) about things that other great minds have come up with.
