## The problem

As in my experience, most large organizations typically have more ideas and projects than there are resources (very good ones!) to do them. Usually this problem is tackled by hiring more resources and hoping that the new resource:
- will easily assimilate into the organization and team.
- will quickly get acquainted with the in house tech and project flow. 
- will be really as good as on the resume. 

But, in reality the cost of acquiring a new talent for a new project is way higher than the returns it promises and will lead to 
- wasted opportunities - As the cost of experimentation becomes higher, not all potential ideas get to see the light of the day.
- lower rate of innovations - innovation can come from many unexpected ideas and an unexplored avenue is a missed opportunity.

## Traditional User Onboarding

### Problems with traditional approach
 

- We cannot accurately forecast our resource needs.
- Resource availability cannot be reliably guaranteed.
- We cannot accurately predict the complexity involved and acquire the right resource for it.
- **We donâ€™t need everybody all the time.**


## Improved On Demand User Onboarding

### Basic pre-requisites for this 

- Every Resource is an expert in his own domain (e:g A expert in UI CSS should not be tasked with picking the right database). Resist the urge to use a single full stack engineer.
- The documentation contains sufficient information to allow any resource to complete any unit of work across any project independently.
- A Resource will only take up a single unit of work at a time.
- Availability of a very good task allocation and tracking software (e:g to Atlassian Jira)


## Transparent resource ratings

## Advantages of this Approach

- Cross project synergies.
- Pool of resources can horizontally scale based on the needs (can avoid imbalances)
- Equally distributed work load across the organization.
- Good tracking of Estimates and Deviations.
- Resource dependencies are virtually eliminated.
- Mentor Apprentice relationship can be easily incorporated and establish a clear career path in the field of expertise.

## Possible dis-advantages of this approach

- This model may not work in an Onsite client relationship model.
- There is a little cost of switching focus or onboarding a new resource to project. The incurred costs become higher if the previous task documentation is not good enough to pick up where it was left off, resources may have to put extra effort while taking up new work. However, this problem can be used as an advantage by using it as proxy metric to quantify the quality of work done (i:e we can deduct that the quality of the work produced is higher if the cost of onboarding a new resource is low and vice-versa)
