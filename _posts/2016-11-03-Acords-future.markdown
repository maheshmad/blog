## Many paths future!
  
At this year's ACORD conference in Boco Raton, their architecture team laid out a game plan to do everything under the sun (I was surprised that it did not include a solution for the world hunger problem). I was only one among the many in the large audience of vendors and carriers who left the Enterprise Architecture session with more questions than we had come in with.
  
The good news is that ACORD knows it has to reinvent and re-tool itself to get ready and survive the next wave of technological innovations (which has already arrived). The leaders in the organization understand that they are at the crossroads and the path they choose will either establish them as an industry leader and enabler, or make them irrelevant to obscurity.
  
## The wrong question:
  
ACORD started in 1970 (imagine the times) by insurance carriers and agents to solve the inefficiencies across the insurance value chain, by standardizing many proprietary forms. That was its core value and was very successful in helping the carriers and vendors speak the same language. Over the years, it innovated itself and the ideas of standardized forms guided the development of electronic xml standards. All along, helping carriers and vendors to adopt and build solutions around the standards. But, things have changed drastically and speed of innovation is leaving carriers behind in their ability to leverage the technological capabilities due to the lack of an updated standardized platform, to keep up with the growing business capability needs.
  
So, In year 2016, in a era of smartphones, is ACORD’s solution roadmap revealing a stark evidence of the wrong questions they are asking?
  
What are the real problems that's plaguing so many projects undertaken by the carriers even in this day and age and how can ACORD help in building the next-gen standards?
  
## The Failed Lego cities:
  
Paraphrasing our company’s founder Ravi Koka (shout out to @rkoka) , a serial entrepreneur who once very wisely said

> “As a technology vendor, we are in the business of building lego blocks, and we enable carriers in building beautiful Lego cities”
  
As an Architect, that beautiful ideology really resonated with me, partly, because I am a huge Lego fan (as my daughter would complain), but mainly because it opens up your imagination and possibilities to deliver innovative solutions, all the while enabling us to deliver high quality and tailored custom fit  components for our heterogeneous clientele, with enterprise grade compliance. So naturally, early on we imagined ACORD to be this metaphorical Lego Company that was setting the standards and guidelines for the lego bricks and we as the vendors would build these beautiful bricks that would (in an Utopian world) easily interlock with every other brick from other vendors.But, unfortunately as the current state would reveal, this Utopian world still remains elusive and out of reach for most carriers. Why is that? Even after heavy investments, there is a long and hard road for enterprises to leverage their investments for any real ROI.
  
What questions can ACORD find answers to make the dream a reality?
  
## The Real Problem:
  
What fundamental need does a standard’s organization like ACORD address in the marketplace?
  
In my opinion, the biggest role a standards organization plays is to free carriers from a vendor lockin and to enable them seamless interoperability. But, unfortunately as our experience has shown, the reality is altogether different. The promises from vendors always comes with a 10 page caveat and constraining fine print disclaimers. But, not all the blame can be attributed to vendor practices, it's the loopholes and the gaps in the standards that has enabled this behavior to go unchecked.
  
As in our metaphorical Lego world, every Lego brick part has a defined specification and a purpose. Every specification is complementing the feature set instead of competing with each other and the most important aspect is, that every brick can lock into any other brick. No matter how many technological innovations enter the marketplace, ACORD needs to fulfill this fundamental need ahead of the technology curve. It should not matter how tomorrow’s (today’s infact) technologies like IOT or Blockchain or Mircoservices is going to revolutionize the world as long as the standards help equip the Carriers with the platform that can ease the adoption.
  
ACORD 3.0 currently, is being perceived as a technology issue , which partly it may be due to issues in its legacy heavyweight XML messages. But its grand vision needs to extend beyond just changing the messaging modality from xml to json.
  
The component micro services architecture can only be realized on the foundations of a solid and iron clad specifications.  But, as many vendors and carriers who have worked with legacy standards have come to realize, it becomes increasingly difficult to curtail deviations in implementation when the specification tend to be open for interpretations.That's the real problem which needs to be addressed first.
  
## Paradox of Extensibility:
  
It must have being very tempting and easy for a standard’s organization like ACORD to add in extensibility as their key selling point. The irony is that this little feature in itself was a trojan horse of trouble. The extensibility like OLifeExtensions in current standards model enable vendor interpretations and open for custom inoperable code modules to sneak in.
  
But, there may not have being an ideal way they could have avoided this, as in the past the standards could never have being able to achieve 100% coverage of all the transactional elements. However, in this crowdsource-able ecology, an  active contributing community can easily extend the model with concrete specifications given the right platform and processes in place.
  
As a Lego company, it should not allow any vendor to create a 7 pin brick.
  
## A Cloud City:
  
The importance of rigid standards is going to be even more important with the transition to cloud platform and microservice components. Carriers are scared to move to cloud because it requires an immense leap of faith on their part to switch from their traditional enterprise model to go for a more nimble and open standards with no backing of a good standards.
